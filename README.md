This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where the component state fails to update correctly after an asynchronous operation. The bug stems from an incorrectly managed dependency array in the `useEffect` hook. The solution provides a corrected version utilizing the correct dependency array and showcases effective asynchronous state management in React Native.
